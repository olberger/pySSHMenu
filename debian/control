Description: Menu for quick connections to your remote hosts
 SSHMenu is a simple GUI app that provides a menu for initiating SSH
 connections. Select a host from the menu and up pops a new terminal
 window containing an SSH session to the selected host.
 .
 pySSHMenu is a port of SSHMenu to Python and Gtk 3 that runs as an
 AppIndicator or StatusIcon rather than as an applet. pySSHMenu reads
 and writes your old SSHMenu configuration files to make transitioning
 easy.
